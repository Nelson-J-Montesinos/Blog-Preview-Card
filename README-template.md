### What I learned

Throughout the development of this project, I gained proficiency in implementing media queries to achieve responsive web design, ensuring the layout adapts effectively across different screen sizes. Additionally, I expanded my knowledge of advanced CSS properties, including the use of object-fit to control how images are displayed within containers when their dimensions differ. I also explored the outline and outline-offset properties, leveraging them to create inner borders without affecting the layout. Furthermore, I deepened my understanding of CSS inheritance, enhancing my ability to manage cascading styles efficiently.
